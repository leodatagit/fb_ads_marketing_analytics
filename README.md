<h3>Optimization suggestions (conclusion)</h3>

<h4>Campaigns:</h4>

<b>916</b>
Increase the budget focusing more in Male between 30-39 and interests between 15-38.

#936
Increase its budget, focusing in the age segment 30-39. It could be interesting to keep announcing for Female.

#1178
To lower the cost per conversion, would be interesting to focus more in the 30-39 public. I'd keep the announcing to F public and use the interests that had more results.
Maybe trying to model the ads of campaign_916 and 936 could improve the conversion rates.

#1500
To drop the cost per conversion, should stop the announcement to F public. 
I'd keep announcing for the 40-49 segments because, despite it's more expensive, it had a lot of conversions.
